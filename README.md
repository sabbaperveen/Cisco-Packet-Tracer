# Cisco Packet Tracer Labs Repository
# Lab Description

This repository contains multiple Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) files for practicing and understanding core networking concepts. Each lab is designed to simulate real-world network topologies and protocols, helping learners strengthen their networking and configuration skills.

#  Files in Repository

OSPF.pkt – Demonstrates the configuration and verification of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol in a simulated environment.

Basic.pkt – Covers fundamental networking concepts, including basic device configuration, IP addressing, and connectivity testing.

FTP.pkt – Focuses on File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server and client setup, showing how data transfer works over a network.

eBGP and OSPF.pkt – Illustrates a combination of External Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP) and OSPF, highlighting how different routing protocols interact.

# Usage

Open the .pkt files using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Follow the device configurations and topology diagrams.

Modify or expand the labs to test additional scenarios.

# Requirements

Cisco Packet Tracer v8.2 or later

Basic knowledge of networking and Cisco CLI

# Purpose

This repository is intended for:

Networking students practicing CCNA-level labs

Cybersecurity learners testing routing and service configurations

Anyone looking to strengthen hands-on networking knowledge
